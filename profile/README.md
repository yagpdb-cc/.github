## Editor Plugins

Writing custom commands, but want to add that little bit of :sparkles: *extra* :sparkles: to your editor? Check out the
following plugins:

### Visual Studio Code

* [yagpdb-cc-ext](https://github.com/SpecialEliteSNP/yagpdb-cc-ext) delivers syntax highlighting for YAGPDB CCs.<br/>
    It highlights functions, variables, features fold recognition as well as automatic indentation.<br/>
    **Unfortunately, it is as of now not maintained, so newer functions may not be highlighted.**

* [gotemplate-syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=casualjim.gotemplate) is a great alternative
    bringing you some basic highlighting to VSCode, however it won't recognise YAGPDB's functions.

### Vim / Neovim

* [yagpdb.vim](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim) brings fully-fledged syntax highlighting to your Vim or Neovim.<br/>
    It is under constant development, with a plethora of features like code-suggestions, copy-to-clipboard, and
    snippets.
